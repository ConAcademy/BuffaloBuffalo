# AGENTS.md - Agent Documentation

## Project Overview

**BuffaloBuffalo** is a TypeScript web application for constructing, visualizing, and interpreting Buffalo sentences—demonstrating how a single word can serve multiple grammatical functions.

## Documentation Map

| File | Purpose | Editable |
|------|---------|----------|
| README.md | Human-readable project overview | Yes |
| AGENTS.md | Agent instructions (this file) | Yes |
| MEMORY.md | Long-term concepts and decisions | Yes |
| PLAN.md | Implementation planning | Yes |
| PROMPTS.md | Auto-generated by hook | **READ ONLY** |

## Core Components

### 1. Parse Tree Generator
- Generic English sentence parser
- Dictionary-driven (lexicon + grammar rules)
- Must handle ambiguous parses (Buffalo sentences have multiple valid trees)
- Unit tests should use non-Buffalo words to verify parser correctness
- Create a Buffalo-specific dictionary with all three parts of speech

### 2. Visualization Engine
- Render parse trees as sentence diagrams
- Preferred style: Reed-Kellogg (elementary school diagrams)
- Must embed cleanly in web application
- Interactive highlighting of sentence components

### 3. Web Application
- Sentence builder UI with part-of-speech selection
- "IDK" wildcard blocks that resolve to most likely parse
- Display all valid parse trees for ambiguous sentences
- Optional LLM interpretation submission

### 4. LLM Integration
- Accept parsed sentence with POS metadata
- Return human-readable interpretation
- API choice TBD (see MEMORY.md)

## Technical Constraints

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework**: Lightweight only—minimize dependencies
- **Testing**: Unit tests for parser with non-Buffalo dictionary
- **Style**: Keep it simple, avoid over-engineering

## Agent Guidelines

1. **Read MEMORY.md** before making architectural decisions
2. **Update MEMORY.md** when making significant decisions
3. **Follow PLAN.md** for implementation order
4. **Never write to PROMPTS.md** (hook-generated)
5. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
6. Keep the codebase minimal and focused

## Key Linguistic Rules

Buffalo has exactly three forms:
- `Buffalo` (proper noun) → the city
- `buffalo` (noun) → the animal
- `buffalo` (verb) → to intimidate

Valid sentence pattern: Any combination where grammar rules allow noun phrases, relative clauses, and transitive verbs to connect meaningfully.
